# Observations
Some observations based on the data and related plots
- Using the box plots of Final Vol by Regimen, Ceftamin seems to have lower efficacy than the other 3 drugs (Capomulin, Ramicane, and Infubinol)
- The results of the analysis also seem to be fairly robust given the large and similar sample size between all regimen types. With the lowest sample size being n=148 for Propriva
